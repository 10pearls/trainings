## Introduction
JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website (for example: games, responses when buttons are pressed  or data entered in forms, dynamic styling, animation). This article helps you get started with this exciting language and gives you an idea of what is possible. For a thorough introduction visit [JavaScript basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) page on [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).

## Data Types
Javascript is a loosely typed language which means it doesn't require you to declare the type ahead of defining the variable. Types are determined automatically while the program is being executed.
Javascript supports the following types:
  + [Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Boolean)
  + [Null](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Null)
  + [Undefined](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Undefined)
  + [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/String)
  + [Number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Number)
  + [Symbol (ES6)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Symbol)
  + [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Object)

## Loops
Like all languages, Javascript has standard loops for iterating over Arrays and Object properties. A detailed guide for loops in Javascript can be found at [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) under [Loops and iteration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration).
